                <h2>HP moves out of the garage</h2>
                <p>HP started off in a <em>one-car garage</em> with nothing but the idea of the future. This company was started by Bill Hewlett and David Packward. Bill Hewlett and David Packward both graduated with degrees in electrical engineering at Stanford University in 1935. HP started with a capital investment of $538, which is equivalent to $9,772 in 2019. Their company went public on November 6, 1957.</p>

                <p>Sales began to increase exponentially that they decided to go <em>global</em> after reaching 5.5 million dollars. They decided to move their organization to Geneva. During the 1960s, they partnered with Sony to develop high-quality products. Those products were a huge cost to the company, as they were not a huge success. </p>

                <p>After the sales of the HP computer grew exponentially, hospitals and clinics decided that it would be be wise and more efficient to input all of the information for patients and work off of the computer. This meant that <em>HP made it into the medical field!</em> This purchase from the medical department really opened more opportunities for the company as they began to be sold all over the world.</p>
